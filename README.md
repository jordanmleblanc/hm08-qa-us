    This project is Sprint 8 Project 8. In this project I run test on the urban routes app. The test on this app allow more test to be performed quickly instead of doing the test manually. The techniques that I used were calling different elements as locators in the project to call in order to keep my code cleaner. Also creating code in order to create a credit card number to put in the credit card section.  To run the test that I created go to the wdio.conf.js file and put in your server URL then in the terminal run npc install then after it installs you will run npm run wdio in the terminal.
