    This project is Sprint 8 Project 8. In this project we run test on the urban routes app in order to make sure there are no bugs. The test performed in urban routes allow more test to be performed quickly instead of doing the test manually. The techniques that I used were calling different elements as locators in the project to call in order to keep my code cleaner. Also creating code in order to create a credit card number to put in the credit card section.  To run the test that I created go to the wdio.conf.js file and put in your server URL then in the terminal run npc install then after it installs you will run npm run wdio in the terminal in order to complete the test in urban routes.
